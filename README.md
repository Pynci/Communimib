Communimib is an Android application that serves as a noticeboard and reporting system to improve communication within the Bicocca university.
The system was designed and developed by Luca Pinciroli, Marco Ferioli and Giulia Raffaella Vitale as part of a bachelor's thesis experiment to test the usefulness of LLMs in software development.
